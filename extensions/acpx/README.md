# @openclaw/acpx

Official ACP runtime backend for OpenClaw.

ACPx lets OpenClaw run external coding harnesses through the Agent Client Protocol while OpenClaw still owns sessions, channels, delivery, permissions, and Gateway state.

## Install

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/acpx
```

Restart the Gateway after installing or updating the plugin.

## What it provides

- ACP-backed agent runtime sessions.
- Plugin-owned session and transport management.
- MCP bridge helpers for OpenClaw tools and plugin tools.
- Static runtime assets used by the ACP process bridge.

## Permission prompts

The default `permissionMode: "approve-reads"` and
`nonInteractivePermissions: "plugin"` combination auto-approves ACP reads and
routes write, execute, and other side-effect prompts through OpenClaw plugin
approvals. The originating chat can then resolve the pending ACP request with
native approval buttons or `/approve <id> allow-once|deny`.

Enable and route `approvals.plugin` for the target channel. Host exec approvals
and channel exec approvers are separate and do not authorize ACPX plugin
approvals. `permissionMode: "approve-all"` remains available as an explicit
no-prompt mode.
